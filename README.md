# XAMLCpp2CsProjection

This is a simple sample to confirm that XAML custom control made by C++/WinRT can be referred by C#.

Currently, this does NOT work.

This repository was made to "Ask Microsoft Q&A" but I'd like to get any help from many persons.

Previously I've made NetProjection repository but it became a little complicated. So I re-make this repository to use simpler samples.

## Motivation

Get performance with C++ and productivity with C#!!!
Here I intended to make moodern desktop app in C# but use DirectX with C++ (in future).
